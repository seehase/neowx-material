## 📥 Installation

### Quick Install

1. **Install the extension:**
   ```bash
   weectl extension install https://github.com/seehase/neowx-material/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
   ```

2. **Restart WeeWX:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart weewx
   ```

3. **Done!** Your new skin should be active.

### Manual Skin Selection

If your skin doesn't change automatically, edit `weewx.conf` and set:
```ini
[[neowx-material]]
   skin = neowx-material
   enable = true
   HTML_ROOT = /var/www/html
```

Then reload WeeWX:
```bash
sudo systemctl reload weewx
```

### Optional: Enhanced Almanac Features

For advanced almanac features (moon phases, celestial body tracking, etc.), install the **weewx-skyfield-almanac** extension:

```bash
weectl extension install https://github.com/roe-dl/weewx-skyfield-almanac/archive/master.zip
```

This is a modern replacement for the deprecated PyEphem and provides:
- Accurate moon phase calculations
- Rise/set times for sun, moon, and planets
- Celestial body positions and visibility
- Eclipse predictions

**Note:** This extension is optional and not part of the skin itself. The skin works without it, but the almanac page will have limited functionality.
