"""Parses the skin's page layout out of skin.conf so the templates don't have to.

Every page has to answer the same question: which cards and charts appear here,
in what order, and which of them are grouped into a collapsible panel?  The
answer lives in skin.conf, and getting it out takes more work than it looks.
configobj returns a list when a value contains commas and a bare string when it
doesn't.  Sections have to be filtered down to the part of the site being
rendered.  An item named twice has to be resolved rather than drawn twice.

Cheetah gives you nowhere good to put that.  A #def is private to the template
that declares it, and an #include does not export its defs to the file that
included it, so any parsing helper written in a template can only spread by
copy-paste.  That is what this module replaced: the same marker-parsing code
inlined into all eight page templates, kept in step by hand.  A SearchList gives
every page one parser, and a layout bug one place to be fixed.

Layout is entirely in this module's hands.  When parse_sections returns nothing,
the page renders no cards and no charts, which is the intended outcome for a
config that was never migrated off the old *_order settings (reported once by
_report_unmigrated).  The side effect is that a parsing bug here surfaces as a
blank page rather than a traceback, so prefer degrading with a warning over
raising.

Layout lives in [Extras][[Appearance]][[[sections]]].  Each section names its
items and, optionally, how to present them:

    [[[[soil]]]]
        items = soilMoist1, soilMoist2
        title = Soil Moisture
        collapsed = true
        content = card

  items      ordered list of cards/charts.  Required.
  title      omit for no panel - the items render loose in the surrounding row
             and 'collapsed' is ignored.
  collapsed  true  -> panel, starts collapsed
             false -> panel, starts expanded (the default)
             none  -> panel chrome, always open, no toggle
  content    card (default), chart, embedded, telemetry, telemetry_chart

Which sections a page shows, and in what order, lives in
[Extras][[Appearance]][[[pages]]]:

    [[[[day]]]]
        sections = overview, temp_charts, soil

  Keys are the $page values the templates carry: day (index and yesterday),
  week, month (this month and the archives), year (likewise), telemetry.
  Sections not listed do not appear on that page.  A page with no entry, a
  page whose entry has no 'sections =' line at all (so commenting the line
  out is safe), and every page when [[[pages]]] is absent, all show every
  section in declaration order.  Writing 'sections =' with nothing after it
  is different from leaving the line out entirely: it means this page
  deliberately shows nothing.  Order sorts WITHIN a content region - cards
  and charts are separate columns, so a mixed list does not interleave them.

Three of the five $page values are shared by two templates apiece: 'day'
covers both the current-conditions page and yesterday, 'month' covers this
month and the archived month pages, and 'year' likewise.  Each such key may
carry sub-blocks that override it for one template only:

    [[[[day]]]]
        sections = cards, charts, embedded
        show_embedded = true
        [[[[[current]]]]]
            show_forecast = true
        [[[[[yesterday]]]]]
            sections = cards, charts

  day    -> current, yesterday
  month  -> month, month_archive
  year   -> year, year_archive
  week and telemetry take no sub-blocks - one template each - so
  [[[[[week]]]]] is never consulted even if someone writes it.

Every setting resolves sub-block, then page block, then a built-in default,
per setting independently: 'yesterday' above overrides 'sections' but still
inherits 'show_embedded' from the 'day' block, since it never sets its own.
page_setting() (panelPageSetting in the search list below) does this
resolution for the two boolean settings, 'show_embedded' and 'show_forecast'.
Both default to true for 'current' and false for every other page and
sub-page, and that default is NOT inherited from the page block - it is
fixed per sub-page name, because 'day' covers both current and yesterday and
only one of them has an embedded region or today's forecast.

configobj folds a plain setting written below a sub-block into that
sub-block, where it silently stops working. _warn_page_blocks() can only
catch this when the absorbing block's name is not a valid sub-page name;
absorption into a valid sub-block is indistinguishable, after parsing, from a
setting deliberately written inside it, so nothing can warn about that case.
skin.conf's [[[pages]]] comments are where this is explained in full.

Sections render in declaration order within each content value.  Items are
de-duplicated within a section, first occurrence winning - the same item may
appear in as many sections as you like and renders once in each.  'forecast' is
the exception: one per page, later occurrences dropped.  The guard is scoped to
a single parse_sections() call, i.e. per content value - which is enough
because 'forecast' only has a render path under content = card.
Each segment also carries a 'slug': the section name reduced to [A-Za-z0-9_-]
and made unique across every section, which the templates emit as data-section.

Registration is not optional.  Without this, the templates call names that were
never added to the search list and the pages fail to generate:

    [CheetahGenerator]
        search_list_extensions = user.panelorder.PanelOrder

Then, in a template that has declared #attr $page (and, where relevant,
#attr $subpage):

    #set $segments = $panelSegments('card', page=$page)
    #set $flat     = $panelItems('chart', page=$page)
    #set $embed    = $panelPageSetting('show_embedded', $page, $subpage)
    #set $isBattery = $isTelemetryItem('outTempBatteryStatus')

panelSegments carries the grouping and is what you loop over to draw a row or a
panel.  panelItems flattens the same data to bare names, for the places that
only need to know whether an item is present, such as the chart JavaScript.
panelPageSetting resolves one of the boolean settings, 'show_embedded' or
'show_forecast', the same sub-block/page/default way described above, for
templates that only need the one value rather than a full section list.
isTelemetryItem classifies a single item name so a template can pick its
rendering: true if the name has a [[[<name>]]] block under [[Telemetry]], or
if it appears in any content = telemetry / telemetry_chart section's items on
any page - either signal is enough, and neither is page-scoped.
